# dApp Alliance - dApp components for other dApp services.
## Universal wallet, Decentralized Avatar & Badge and Digital Contents Store.

The dApp services consist of a number of contracts, and most projects are open source. Other developers can refer to these codes or add them to the project to develop their own services. There are contracts that are deployed redundantly for each service, which leads to resource waste. Therefore, a dApp should be developed independently for a specific service so that it can be used as a part of other services.
The advantage of this development is that it eliminates redundantly distributed contracts. In addition, you can improve the quality of your service by sharing user information gathered through public contracts. And we can concentrate on the development of real service, so we can develop quality service.

### Universal wallet (for all erc20 tokens and ethereum).
Universal wallet is a dapp that makes erc20 tokens available for commerce. Using standard interfaces between stores and wallets, we reduced calls to the contract from two to one.

### Avatar & Badge System.
It is an avatar dapp that can be used in other services using ethereum or dapps based on ethereum address. This is a dapp that creates avatar store dapp, but does not makes avatar directly. You can use this decentralized dapp to create your own avatar store without any restrictions, and created avatars can implement a service, and you can also show avatars on all services that use the ethereum address. So with dapp, you can make your own service more user friendly, and avatars will make the Etherium ecosystem richer too.

Unlike most dapps, which are self-centered, as opposed to decentralization, avatar dapp has been developed with the goal of being available to other services and dapps.

And the stores will be able to set erc20 tokens to use, which will help develop the Etherium ecosystem.
